- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for runtime JavaScript.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework for Node.js.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to reload the server automatically.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/what) for hosting for deployment.
- [Trello](https://trello.com) for agile team working development.
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) for domain modelling.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) for planning, pair-programming, info-sharing & regular check-ins.
- [Github](https://github.com/) and Git for version control.

Planning & Implementation:
--------

- `The DOM modelling was done in `Excalidraw` to plan the layout of our one-page React app.`

- `We used `Trello` to plan out our tickets for deploying each feature`\
`moving them along as they were implemented & completed.`

Installation:
------

- Fork from one of our repositories https://github.com/rupertpople/seedle.git for example.
- Clone your new forked repository using `git clone` followed by your fork URL.
- Move into the repository by using `cd seedle`.


Available Scripts:
------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
